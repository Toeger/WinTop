# WinTop
Set or remove top level status of any window so the window either stays on top or stops doing that.

#Usage
Open WinTop, click on "Select", click on the window you care about, then click on "Top" or "Bottom". Bottom is the default setting.

#How to get it to work
You can just run the wintop.exe and pray I am a nice person. If you are not the religious type you should instead download [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs) (free), create a new Windows (not Console!) project, copy wintop.cpp (better the content) into it, check if I put anything nasty into the code and compile and run it yourself.
