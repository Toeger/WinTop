# WinTop
Set or remove top level status of any window so the window either stays on top or stops doing that.

#Usage
Open WinTop, click on "Select", click on the window you care about, then click on "Top" or "Bottom". Bottom is the default setting.

#How to get it to work
You can just run the wintop.exe and pray I am a nice person. If you are not the religious type you should instead download [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs) (free), create a new Windows (not Console!) project, copy wintop.cpp (better the content) into it, check if I put anything nasty into the code and compile and run it yourself.

#Limitations
* Only works on Windows.
* It is ugly.
* There are some windows that undo their always on top flag immediately such as some versions of Opera, nothing WinTop can do about that.

If you cannot run the .exe because some .dll is missing you can either compile it yourself or create an issue for this project or send me a message.
